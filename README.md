## Towers of Hanoi

This is a Python terminal game implementing the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.
I saw this when looking over the Codecademy course syllabus for DSA. I thought it looked interesting, so I decided to implement it with some extra validation
and features. It has been good practice using stacks :).


## How to Play

1. The game starts with all disks on the **Left stack**, arranged from largest at the bottom to smallest at the top.
2. Your goal is to move all disks to the **Right stack** following these rules:
   - Only one disk can be moved at a time.
   - You can only move the top disk from a stack.
   - No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

3. The program will track the number of moves you make, and you can try to solve it in the **minimum number of moves**.
